# ios-contacts-codingchallenge
This is an iOS app which I made for the coding challenge in a company I applied.


**Basic Description:**
It is an iOS app that pulls data from a local JSON file. It shows a list of persons names and their emails.
It displays a simple master-detail using tableView. If the user taps on one of the lists, the app shows a Detail View
which gives more information about the person. If the user taps the button 'Friends' on the navigation bar, it shows the person's list of friends.


**Architecture used:**
I used the MVC architecture because it most common design pattern on iOS since they have started and also it is easiest to implement.
